* Common Lisp - My Anime List

MAL, My Anime List, is a list of anime and LISP stands for List Processing, so I made this Common Lisp library for talking to the MAL server.

** Authentication

All API functions take keyword arguments for user credentials.

#+NAME authenticate
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(media-search :anime "my-query terms" :username "me" :password "password1")
(add-entry (make-instance 'anime-id 4) :username "me" :password "password1")
(update-entry (make-instance 'media-id 4) :username "me" :password "password1")
(delete-entry (make-instance 'media-id 4) :username "me" :password "password1")

#+END_SRC

 is stored in two special variables. You can reassign them or shadow them.

#+NAME authenticate
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

;; Reassign variables and search with credentials.
(setf *username* "me")
(setf *password* "password1")
(media-search :anime "monster")

#+END_SRC
